Trinity College Dublin - Senior Sophister - Machine Learning Course Competition Submission

The final submission makes use of the XGBoost Regressor. However, my code for CatBoost is commented out in this file as this was my second best score and wasn't far off my score using XGBoost. Some parameters are also commented out for both regressors, as these are some that I tested and usd either intiially or throughout but didn't contribute to my best score.
